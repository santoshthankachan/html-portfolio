<p>I am a born again Christian currently based in Perth, Western Australia. God has been teaching me new truths daily through His Word, Life's little Experiences and sometimes through His wonderful people around me. Sometimes I feel so special because God has chosen me to be His Child. We being the Child of God have the divine privilege to approach Him at any time and in all circumstances of our lives. Many times we tend to neglect this great love of our God towards us. During my professional career I met many people, made many friends and lost many but I was never alone because my Almighty God and My Savior Christ is always with me.</p>

<p>Bible Says, “Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him! - Psalms 34:8.</p>

  God Bless You <br />
